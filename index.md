# Sietse Ringers

I am a PhD student at the [University of Groningen](http://www.math.rug.nl/jbi/) and the [Radboud University](http://www.ru.nl/ds/), mostly interested in secure and privacy-friendly identity management. Before that my research involved the mathematical side of [gauge theories and partial differential equations](files/mscthesis.pdf).

## Attribute-based credentials
With an attribute-based credential scheme, you can selectively show some of your properties, while keeping others to yourself (more detailed explanation [here](https://www.irmacard.org/irma/)). [Idemix](http://www.zurich.ibm.com/idemix/) is an example of such a scheme; it is used in the IRMA project. [Jaap-Henk Hoepman](http://www.cs.ru.nl/~jhh/), [Eric Verheul](http://www.cs.ru.nl/E.Verheul/) and myself are currently working on a new, smart-card suitable attribute-based credential scheme (draft [here](files/abc.pdf)).

## The IRMA project
For several years, the [IRMA project](https://www.irmacard.org) has been working on implementing attribute-based credentials on smart cards and on Android, using Idemix as underlying credential scheme. It is [open source](https://github.com/credentials/), and I have been contributing to it since June 2015.

## Partially blind signature schemes
Although digital signatures already are a very versatile cryptographic primitive as is, in some situations it is desirable that (part of) the message and the resulting signature is hidden from the issuer – for example, when the issuer is not fully trusted, or when the user's privacy is at stake. In such situations one can use [(partially) blind signature schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_signature). Wouter Lueks, [Jaap-Henk Hoepman](http://www.cs.ru.nl/~jhh/) and myself have developed a partially blind issuing protocol for [Boneh-Boyen signatures](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-24676-3_4). A draft is available [here](files/bbb.pdf); as an example of our scheme we included a (single-show) attribute-based credential scheme, offering similar efficiency but stronger security guarantees than its most well-known competitor ([U-Prove](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/u-prove/)).
